    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>
      This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about cooking technique called
      <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerde the food
      (usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a water bath thar is a precisele
      set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his
      book, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes ir as "ultra-low
      temperature poaching".

      Next month, we will be serving
      <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat
      ar the chef table, contact us before November 30.
